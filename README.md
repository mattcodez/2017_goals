# 2017 Goals
_Repo for managing personal goals and their sub tasks_

**Remember to ask: will I enjoy doing these as much as accomplishing the end result? Do they start with seeking God's kingdom and rightousness/justice first?**

### Notes
* Focus on the change the book led to in the reviewer, rather than on the book itself.

### Ideas
* "How to Write a Book I'll Read"
* Lifehacker like titles, aggregate lists. (e.g. 5 books to read to get in shape)
 * Consider niche topics for the lists.
* "One Book that Changed my Life"
* Make a list of 20 or 20 books to read for 2017. 
 * People want to know what to read.
